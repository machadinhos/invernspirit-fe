  "text1": "I've always been drawn to the mysterious and eerie beauty of Nordic landscapes, and I love incorporating those elements into my work. The dark colors and shadows add an extra layer of depth and intrigue to each piece.",
  "text2": "As a child, I was always fascinated by the textures and shapes of broken objects, and that's something I try to capture in my ceramics. The subtle imperfections and worn edges give each piece a unique character, don't you think? And speaking of character, I adore adding old traces and patina to my work — it gives it a sense of history and story.",
  "text3": "In fact, my background in scenography and interior design has been incredibly influential on my ceramics.",
  "text4": "I love thinking about the spaces where people will display or use these pieces — how they'll be lit, what colors will surround them, and how they'll interact with the other objects in the room. It's all about creating a sense of atmosphere and mood.",
  "text5": "As I venture into the architecture world, I'm excited to bring my visual sensibilities and passion for texture and form to bear on larger-scale projects. Who knows — maybe one day I'll design a building that incorporates some of those same broken, worn textures into its walls or furniture!",
  "text6": "For now, though, it's all about building my online presence as a ceramics artist.",
